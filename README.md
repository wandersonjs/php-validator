A PHP validator built from scratch, inspired by Laravel's validator.

This PHP validator is a tool developed from the ground up, based on the principles of Laravel's validator. Its purpose is to verify and validate input data in a robust and efficient manner. Here are some benefits and utilities that this validator can offer:

Security: Prevents invalid or malicious data from entering the system, protecting against attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Reliability: Ensures that the received data is in the correct format and type, reducing errors and inconsistencies.

Flexibility: Allows the creation of custom validation rules according to the specific needs of the application, facilitating maintenance and scalability.

Ease of Use: Although it's made in pure PHP, it follows the syntax and logic of Laravel's validator, making it intuitive for developers familiar with Laravel.

Performance: Being developed in pure PHP, it can be lighter and faster without the need to load the full Laravel framework.
